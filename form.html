                    <p class="card-text">Good nutrition is about healthy eating. This means regularly
                        choosing
                        healthy foods and beverages. A healthy eating plan
                        should give your body the energy and nutrients that you need every day. Nutrients
                        include
                        proteins, carbohydrates, fats,
                        vitamins, minerals, and water. The plan should also take into account your
                        preferences,
                        cultural traditions, and budget.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a good sleep, you may
                        become
                        more
                        easily annoyed and angry. Over the long
                        term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to become depressed. So it's
                        important to make sure that you have
                        a regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night.</p>
